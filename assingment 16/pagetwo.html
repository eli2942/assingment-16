        All modern day sloths are tree-dwelling, suspensorial mammals, spending most of their lives hanging motionless or slowly moving between tree branches using their long, curved claws. Everything from feeding, sleeping, resting to mating and giving birth happens in the trees. But there are times when even sloths must leave the comfort of their tree canopies and descend to the ground.
